# Iris_Classification_using_NaiyeBayes
The Naïve Bayes Classifier is a famous classification method used for predicting the outcome of datasets.

The Iris dataset in CSV is computed as the input.

Choose the naïve Bayes laplace_correction parameter as input to grid search optimization algorithm.

Apply the optimal value of the laplace_correction parameter as an initial value to the process of classification using naïve Bayes.

Utilize the model and generate predictions.

Determine the prediction accuracy through the comparison of the class data of test dataset. This accuracy is evaluated based on the ratio between 0 to 100%.
